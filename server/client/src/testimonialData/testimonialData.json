He was able to guide me through a shoulder injury and keep me on track despite the limitations it placed on my ability to lift.He has the breadth of knowledge and experience to handle any client who comes to him - from those just getting started on their fitness journey to those who have been at it for years and are looking for that extra intensity and techniques to take their workouts to the next level. Personal trainers are a dime a dozen but when you find someone who can challenge you guide you and continually help to make you better great things are possible. Including great glutes !I would know."
